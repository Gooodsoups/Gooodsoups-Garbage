A mod full of random jokers and other stuff that either makes the game fun or boring idk when only having like no jokers yet, I'm still adding stuff to make the mod bigger and better (or worse you never know)

This mod currently has:

- 28 Jokers
- 1 Enhancement
- 4 Editions
- 4 Decks
- 2 Spectrals
- 2 New Vouchers (Since I overriden two vouchers so the UI doesn't look bad in game)
