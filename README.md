A mod full of random jokers and other stuff that either makes the game fun or boring idk when only having like no jokers yet, I'm still adding stuff to make the mod bigger and better (or worse you never know)

This mod currently has:

- 29 Jokers
- 1 Enhancement
- 4 Editions (gotta fix rusty at some point)
- 6 Decks
- 2 Spectrals
- A New Consumable Type (3 new cards in relation to this new type, they are pretty cool ig) 
- 2 New Vouchers (May show 4 since I overriden two vouchers so the UI doesn't look bad in game)
- Maybe a few Stakes (the stickers still don't want to localize properly lmao)


- And maybe a freeze mechanic in the future if I figure out how to do that, which I honestly do not know how to lol
